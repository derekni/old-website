subtitle: Who I am and what I like to do
---

I am a freshman at Cornell University who is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am extremely passionate about coding and love to develop projects in my free time, some of which are featured in my resume, and some of which are currently works in progress. I love spending time with my friends playing ping pong, watching TV, and going out for bubble tea and dinner.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
