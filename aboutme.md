### About Me

I am a sophomore at Cornell University who is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am extremely passionate about coding and love to develop projects in my free time, some of which are featured in my resume, and some of which are currently works in progress. I love spending time with my friends playing ping pong, eating food, and hanging out in nature. I also love music and podcasts, and spend a lot of my time listening to music or podcasts on Spotify while working out or relaxing.

### Music

My favorite artists are Frank Ocean, Quinn XCII, and Khalid. My favorite song of all time is A Drop in the Ocean by Ron Pope. Some of my other favorites are Too Good by Drake, Location by Khalid, and Good Old Days by Macklemore. Favorite song to dance to: Teach Me How to Dougie by Cali Swag District.

### TV Shows

I love to watch movies and TV. My favorite movie of all time is Good Will Hunting, and I really enjoy Your Name too. As for TV shows, my favorite show is Your Lie in April, but Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is up there too. I also love The Office (who doesn't) and Friends.

### Books

My favorite book of all time is The Great Gatsby. My other favorites include Gone With the Wind and Can't Hurt Me. I'm currently reading Atomic Habits, and really wish I had read this book earlier.

### Hobbies

In my free time I love to spend time hanging out with friends, trying new foods, and being in nature. I love playing Spikeball, tennis, and ping pong with friends. When I'm not hanging out with my friends, you can often find me at the gym, or exploring the great outdoors. A recent hobby I picked up is snowboarding, which is amazing because you can talk to friends while on the lifts and then race friends down the slopes.
