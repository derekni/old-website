### About Me

I am a freshman at Cornell University who is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am extremely passionate about coding and love to develop projects in my free time, some of which are featured in my resume, and some of which are currently works in progress. I love spending time with my friends playing ping pong, watching TV, and going out for bubble tea and dinner. I also love listening to music, and spend a lot of my time listening to music on Spotify while working out or studying.

### Music Taste

My favorite artists are LANY, Drake, Khalid, gnash, and Ed Sheeran. My favorite song of all time is A Drop in the Ocean by Ron Pope. Some of my other favorites are Too Good by Drake, Location by Khalid, Good Old Days by Macklemore, and Everything You Are by Ed Sheeran. 

### Favorite Shows

I love to watch movies and TV. My favorite movie of all time is Kimi no Na Wa, but Good Will Hunting is a close second. As for TV shows, my favorite show is Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April), but Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is up there too. I also love The Office (who doesn't) and Friends.

### Favorite Books

My favorite book of all time is Looking For Alaska by John Green, but it's kind of a guilty pleasure. My other favorite books are Me Before You, Gone With the Wind, and Pride and Prejudice.

### Hobbies

In my free time I love to spend time hanging out with friends. I love playing Spikeball and tennis, and I also play ping pong a lot with friends. We also play video games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Mario Kart, both of which I'm basically unbeatable at. When I'm not hanging out with my friends or watching TV, you can often find me at the gym, where I work to get big. I also spend a lot of time in the kitchen, since I love cooking and baking. You might also find me reading a good book outside when the weather is nice.
