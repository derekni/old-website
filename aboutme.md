subtitle: Who I am and what I like to do
---

I am a freshman at Cornell University who is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am extremely passionate about coding and love to develop projects in my free time, some of which are featured in my resume, and some of which are currently works in progress. I love spending time with my friends playing ping pong, watching TV, and going out for bubble tea and dinner. I also love listening to music, and spend a lot of my time listening to music on Spotify while working out and studying.

### Music Taste

My favorite artists are LANY, Russ, Khalid, gnash, and blackbear. Some of my favorite songs are Too Good by Drake, Foreplay by Jalen Santoy, Do Not Disturb by Drake, and Location by Khalid. Kamikaze by Lil Mosey is amazing too. 

### Favorite Shows

I love to watch movies and TV. My favorite movie of all time is Kimi no Na Wa, but some close seconds include Good Will Hunting and The Notebook. As for TV shows, my favorite show is Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April), but Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is up there too. I also watched The Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, which were my favorite shows in middle school.

### Hobbies

In my free time I love to spend time with friends goofing off. I love playing Spikeball and tennis, and I also play ping pong a lot with friends. We also play video games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Mario Kart, both of which I'm basically unbeatable at. When I'm not hanging out with my friends or watching TV, you can often find me at the gym, where I work to get big. I'll also spend a lot of time in the kitchen, since I love cooking (I mostly just stick to one dish though, since I'm not very good at cooking), and I also like to bake cookies.
