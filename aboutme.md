### About Me

I am a Cornell Engineer who is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am extremely passionate about coding and love to develop projects in my free time, some of which are featured in my resume, and some of which are currently works in progress. I also enjoy spending time with my friends playing ping pong, eating food, and exploring nature. I also love podcasts, and spend a lot of my time listening to podcasts on Spotify while working out.

### Music

My favorite artists are Frank Ocean, Quinn XCII, and Khalid. My favorite song of all time is A Drop in the Ocean by Ron Pope. Some of my other favorites are Too Good by Drake, Location by Khalid, and Good Old Days by Macklemore. Favorite song to dance to: Teach Me How to Dougie by Cali Swag District.

### TV Shows

My favorite movie of all time is Good Will Hunting, and I really enjoy Your Name too. My favorite shows are Attack on Titan, Your Lie in April, and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

### Books

My favorite book of all time is The Great Gatsby. My other favorites include Gone With the Wind and Can't Hurt Me. I'm currently reading Atomic Habits, and really wish I had read this book earlier.

### Hobbies

I love playing Spikeball, tennis, and ping pong with friends. When I'm not hanging out with my friends, you can often find me at the gym, or exploring the great outdoors. Recent interests I have picked up include snowboarding, running, and meditating.
