<h1>Ascii Stream</h1>

<p>
  I recently developed Ascii Stream which won 2nd Best Overall Hack at IvyHacks
  2020! Ascii Stream is a video call web app which uses ASCII art instead of
  video to save on bandwidth. Sending video can be expensive, but sending text
  isn't. Ascii Stream converts video to ASCII art locally, and uses PeerJS, an
  open-source wrapper around WebRTC, to send audio and ASCII art (as text)
  between users.

<h1>Jimmy Jumper</h1>

<p>
  Jimmy Jumper is an endless running and jumping game developed in Unity. Since
  this was my first 3D game, I learned a lot about manipulating camera angles
  and building the game scene, as well as optimizing resources. I also use
  animations to trigger different events, and I randomly generate the game scene
  as the player runs, so no run is ever the same.

<h1>Johnny Jumper</h1>

<p>
  Johnny Jumper is a game developed with Phaser. I originally planned to make it
  a FaceBook Messenger game, but publishing on FaceBook is much harder than on
  the App Store. Even though technology is so advanced, it's very easy to have
  too much going on in the background at once, so I reduced the number of tile
  layers and used sub-maps instead of one big map to make it faster.

<h1>TaskTime</h1>

<p>
  I often find myself procrastinating on my work, even when I know I would be
  happier if I just did my work first. Then I could watch Netflix happily,
  rather than stressfully thinking about my assignments due the next day. I
  created TaskTime to combat procrastination, by gamifying to-dos and good
  habits. TaskTime allows you to earn points for tasks and habits, which you can
  spend on rewards such as watching Netflix or buying bubble tea.

</p>

<p>
  Side note: Around 6 months after publishing TaskTime, I tried to push an
  update, and it got rejected due to its similarity to another app on the App
  Store. I looked up the app, and someone took all the code from my Github and
  published it without changing a thing! Definitely a good lesson in keeping
  repos private.
