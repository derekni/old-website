<h1>Jimmy Jumper</h1>

<p>
  My most recent project is Jimmy Jumper, developed in the summer of 2020. It is
  an endless running and jumping game developed in Unity. It taught me a lot
  about how to use Unity, how to code in C# (which actually isn't very hard,
  it's super similar to Java). Since this was my first 3D game, I learned a lot
  about manipulating camera angles and building the game scene, as well as
  optimizing resources. I also learned about using animations to trigger events,
  manipulating when different animations are called, and randomly developing the
  game scene as the player moves, so as not to render the whole map at the
  start.

<h1>Johnny Jumper</h1>

<p>
  Johnny Jumper was my first game, and in making it I realized game development
  is nothing like I expected. I made it using Phaser in the winter of 2019, and
  originally planned to make it a FB Messenger game, but I am still in the
  process of publishing there. Things I expected to be hard, like setting up the
  environment and porting to the Apple Store, were very easy processes to
  follow. Also, things I expected to be easy, like coding the logic in the game
  and the physics of objects (which there are built-in packages for), proved to
  be difficult. I also never realized how important graphics are, and how hard
  they are to create, so I used free assets I found online. In addition, phones
  might be fast nowadays but it's very easy to have too much going on at once.

<h1>TaskTime</h1>

<p>
  I often find myself procrastinating on my work, even when I know I would be
  happier if I just did my work first. Then I could watch Netflix happily,
  rather than stressfully thinking about my assignments due the next day. I
  created TaskTime in my junior year to combat procrastination, by gamifying
  to-dos and good habits. I earned points for completing tasks, which I spent on
  Netflix episodes and bubble tea. This helped my grades immensely, and also
  taught me all the parts to publishing an app. A lot of it wasn't just code,
  there was a lot of paperwork to read and contracts to sign. Different devices
  also have different screen sizes, so I had to account for that too. I
  developed TaskTime using Swift in XCode.
</p>

<p>
  Side note: You might notice that TaskTime is on my Github, but not my other
  two projects. Around 6 months after publishing TaskTime, I tried to publish an
  update, and it got rejected, due to its similarity to another app on the App
  Store. When I looked up TaskTime, I found someone else had taken all my code,
  and published it without changing a thing! It took a while to work out taking
  it down, as well as being able to push updates, so I now keep such work in
  private repos.
